<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Dynaphopy calculates the phonon linewidths and frequency shifts analizing the power spectrum of the velocity projected into the
phonon modes coordinates. As a first step the velocity is be projected into the point in thereciprocal space (wave vector) in which 
the harmonic phonon modes are defined.
To calculate this power spectrum dynaphopy can use either <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FourierTransform.html">Fourier transform</a>, or <a href="http://cmm.cit.nih.gov/maxent/letsgo.html">Maximum Entropy Method</a>(MEM). Fourier transform is a robust method widely used in many fields 
of physics to descompose signals into elemental frequencies without information loss. On the other hand, MEM is a very fast method that approximates the whole signal into a much simpler function made by the most representative frequencies. This way it allows to separate the noise from the important data showing smoother spectra that becomes easier to analize. For this reason MEM is highly recomended when working with very long MD. Fourier transform algorith can be used in short MD simulations and eventually to corroborate the results obtained using MEM.  

<h3>Power spectra</h3>
<p>The power spectrum calculated by Dynaphopy can be either displayed in a matplotlib X window or stored in a file. The selection of the algorithm used to calculate the power spectra is defined by <strong>-psm</strong> flag followed by algorithm number.
<br>At the present time there are 5 algorithms available:</p>
<UL>
<LI>0: Fourier transform algorithm using parallel python module
<LI>1: Maximum Entropy Method using parallel python module
<LI>2: Fourier transform algorithm serial
<LI>3: Fourier transform algorithm parallel using OpenMP.
<LI>4: Maximum Entropy mMthod algorithm parallel using OpenMP.
</UL>
<em>Algorithms 0 and 1 and are essencially for testing purposes so algorithms 2, 3 and 4 are <strong>strongly</strong> recomended. 
If not specified algorithm 4 is used.</em>

<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -psm 4</code></pre>
<p> Fourier methods do not require additional parameters but Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) does. MEM allows to obtain smoother and faster 
power spectra interpolating the velocity using a polynomia which depends on a certain number of coefficents. The higher this number is, the heavier the calculation becomes and the result becomes closer to Fourier transfom solution. Fortunatelly, usually the convergence of the peaks shape in MEM can be found with 1000-3000 coeficients obtaining a very good performance. By default the number of coefficents used is 1000 but it can be changed using <strong>-cf</strong> followed by the number of coeficients.</p>

<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -cf 2000</code></pre>

<UL>
<LI><h5>Full power spectra</h5>
<p> 
This options calculate the power spectra directly from cartesian coordinates velocity without peforming any projection. That means that in principle it contains all the phonon frequencies present in the crystal. At infinite time steps limit, this power spectrum tends to the vibrational density of states (VDoS).
</p>
<p>Plot spectrum in a matplotlib X window:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -pd</code></pre>
<p>Save spectrum to file:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -sd filename</code></pre>

<LI><h5>Wave vector projection power spectra</h5>
<p>This options request the  velocity to be projected into a point in the reciprocal space (wave vector) and obtain the power spectrum.
<p>Plot spectrum in a matplotlib X window:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -pw</code></pre>
<p>Save spectrum to file:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -sw filename</code></pre>

<LI><h5>Phonon modes projection power spectra</h5>
<p>This option requests the velocity to be projected into a point in the reciprocal space (wave vector) and additionally
projected it into each of the harmonic phonon modes defined in this point. This option requieres phonopy to be correctlly installed and 
<strong>FORCE_SETS</strong> file has to be calculated first. The result is a set of phonon mode projections (one for each phonon)
which are either displayed in the screen in diferent windows or stored in a file (one column for each phonon) sorted from lower 
to higher frequency.

<p>Plot spectrum in a matplotlib X window:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -pp</code></pre>
<p>Save spectrum to file:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -sp filename</code></pre>

<LI><h5>Additional options</h5>
<p>Use <strong>-r</strong> option to change the power spectrum range and resolution (start, end, number of points).</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -r 0 25 100</code></pre>
<p>Use <strong>-q</strong> to change the recirpocal space point (wave vector) into which the velocity is projected. This option
takes 3 real numbers (wave vector in reduced coordinates).
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -q 0.5 0 0.5</code></pre>

<p>The number of time steps used to calculate the power spectra may have great influence in the final result. By default 
it takes the <strong>last 2000</strong> time steps but <strong>-n</strong> flag allows to change this value. This flag is followed by
 the number of last time steps to be used in the calculation. It is recomended to leave some 
stabilitzation time steps in the begining to ensure that the MD is totally converged. In interactive mode, using this flag is also
used to define the number of time steps to use.
<br><em>If the OUTCAR file contains less time steps than the especified in <strong>-n</strong> flag, all time steps will be used.</em></p>

<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -n 5000</code></pre>

<p>All these option can be combined to obtain the desired results. In interactive mode these options can also be used as initial 
paramters that can be changed inside interactive menus. The only exception is <strong>-n</strong> flag that cannot be changed. 
For very long MD the amount of RAM memory needed to do the calculations can be huge so the initial discarted time steps are erased 
from memory at the begining of the execution.
</UL>

<h3>Obtaining anharmonic phonon properties</h5>
<p> 
Phonon linewidhts and frequency shifts can be obtained by direct analysis of power spectra. Using phonon modes projections
are the best way to analize the individual phonons since they are completly separated in individual power spectra containing only
one peak. Dynaphopy offers a tool to automatically fit the
obtained spectra to lorentzian functions and display the results on the screen. This tool is called peak analysis and is
requested through flag <strong>-pa</strong>.
<br><em>This option works better with MEM method since the obtained sprectra are smoother. In case of Fourier trasform calculations
some smoothing methods may be used before fitting.</em>

<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -pa</code></pre>
<p> 
When the calculation is finished individual information for each phonon is displayed on the screen. Widht and position correspond directly
to the phonon linewidths and peak anharmonic frequency. Frequency shifts are calculated from the diference between the harmonic frequency
and calculated anharmonic frequency (position) for each peak.
</p>
<pre><code>Peak # 4------------------------------------Width (FWHM): 0.942807095508 THzPosition: 16.2166860349 THzArea: 4250.53142961 THzFrequency shift: 0.956759285644 THzFitting Error (RMS): 690.223340187</code></pre><p>
When the calculation is finished, for each peak a matplotlib X window apear in the screen showing the result of the fitting for visual analysis.
For new systems is strongly recomended to check for each phonon spectrum fitting to ensure that it has been succesfully performed.
To do calculations in batch, flag <strong>--silent</strong> may be used. With this flag only the text data is shown.
information wich can be stored in a file redirecting the output.   
</p>
<pre><code>$ ./dynaphopy input_file OUTCAR -pa --silent > output.log</code></pre>
